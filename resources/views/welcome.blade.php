                  <p>I try. I promise I'm not trolling. I also am not sure what my alias is, my nickname Alex? my username in most spaces RoyalTrickster?</p>

               <h1>About me part 2</h1>
 <p>I like Tabletops, gaming, and technology. </p>
 <p>This is Ezreal, from League's Real Life Alternate Universe. He's a part of a boyband, it may look unrelated but this is my work aspiration, I aspire to one day have some sort of creative position in which I develop something that spawns a fandom. My academic interests revolve around seemingly random topics, starting from cybersecurity all the way to 3D modeling.</p>
